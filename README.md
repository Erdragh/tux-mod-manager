# Tux Mod Manager
TMM is a Linux native mod manager made with the Tauri toolkit, it can, install, load, remove, and deploy mods for both linux native and wine games.

## TMM Roadmap
 - ðŸŸ¢ Move the current mod manager logic to rust
 - ðŸŸ¢ Implement a OFS (Overlay File System, similar to VFS from MO2)
 - ðŸ”´ Add visual indication that a mod is installing
 - ðŸ”´ Rewrite scan_games() using the libraryfolder.vdf instead of searching for steam directories intrusively 
 - ðŸ”´ Implement a game launcher for native and proton games (for the OFS)
 - ðŸ”´ Implement a per-game load order
 - ðŸ”´ Implement mod profiles
 - ðŸ”´ Create cli commands, example to launch a game from steam with a specifc profile without having to use the mod manager
